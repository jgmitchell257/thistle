# thistle

Collection of Python tools and functions. Created and used by me on the regular.

May or may not be useful to others.

## Why
These are things I always find myself using and/or recreating regularly for my day to day work.

I'm a big believer in open source and figure if someone else can use them, make them better, or simply learn something new then I want that to happen.

* /bash - dumping ground for bash scripts and notes
* /docs - documentation
* /thistle - functions, modules, and other common goods
