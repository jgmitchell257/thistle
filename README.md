# thistle

Collection of Python tools, functions, shell scripts, and notes. Created and used by me on the regular.

Mostly having to do with Cisco UC servers and infrastructure. May or may not be useful to others.

## Why
These are things I always find myself using and/or recreating regularly for my day to day work.

I'm a big believer in open source and figure if someone else can use them, make them better, or simply learn something new then I want that to happen.

## Install
I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage my virtual environments, libraries, and modules. I recommend it to all my friends and family.

For now, I recommend cloning the thistle repo locally and then using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install the requirements in it's own virtual environment.

## Tools
- __/bash__ - dumping ground for bash scripts and cli command notes
- __/docs__ - documentation (yeah, right)
- __/thistle__ - functions, modules, and other common goods
