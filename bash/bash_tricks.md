# Open editor for extended/complex commands
`ctrl+x+e`

# Get DNS and networking information
`dig <hostname>`

`whois -v <ip_address> | grep origin -i`

Create a file of patterns to search for and use that to search for multiple strings at once:

`whois -v <ip_address> | grep -i --file=patterns`

-i ignores case

-E allows for regex in the patterns file:

`grep -E -i --file=patterns`

# Searching for sensitive data and strings in files and folders
`grep -r "my secert pattern" .`


```
$ grep -r password .
